Hi, my name is Gustavo Siqueira, I live in Curitiba-PR, Brazil and I'm currently working for Grupo Boticario.

A little bit about my professional background, I have a degree in Computer Engineering. During college I did some courses to learn how to develop mobile applications, one of those courses was the Apple Developer Academy, a great iniciative from Apple together with some universities in Brazil, shortly after that I started  working as a mobile app developer. As the time passed by I started transitioning my career to work as a backend developer, a that's what I'm doing for the past 8 years.

Some of my interests are technology(oh really?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), music and games, in my spare time I find my self playing with my kids, studying new tech and reading fantasy novels.
