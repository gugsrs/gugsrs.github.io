Hej, I'm Gustavo, I've recently moved to Gothenburg, Sweden, to work at Sebratec AB as a software developer.

A little bit about my professional backgroung, I have a degree in Computer Engineering. During college I did some courses to learn how to develop mobile applications, one of those courses was the Apple Developer Academy, a great iniciative from Apple together with some universities in Brazil, shortly after that I started  working as a mobile app developer. As the time passed by I started transitioning my career to work as a backend developer, a that's what I'm doing for the past 5 years.

Some of my interests are technology(oh really?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), music and games, in my spare time I find my self playing with my toddler and lately I've been trying to learn some swedish.
